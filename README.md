Video Game Sales Analysis Using SQL

This project involves leveraging SQL queries to analyze a comprehensive video game sales dataset. The dataset encompasses information about various video games, including details such as game titles, genres, release dates, platforms, publishers, and sales figures across different regions.

The project is structured to cover three levels of SQL query complexity: simple, intermediate, and advanced. Participants will start by executing basic queries to extract fundamental insights, such as total sales, top-selling genres, and popular platforms. Intermediate queries will delve into more specific analyses, exploring trends over time, regional variations, and publisher performance. The advanced queries will involve complex operations, subqueries, and joins to uncover nuanced patterns, such as user demographics, market saturation, and correlations between critical factors.

Through this project, participants will enhance their SQL skills by applying them to real-world scenarios in the gaming industry. The analysis will not only provide a deeper understanding of the dataset but also offer valuable insights for stakeholders, game developers, and publishers in the dynamic video game market.
